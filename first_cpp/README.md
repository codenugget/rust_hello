## Build steps:

You need a C++ compiler with support for intrinsic headers, i.e. Visual Studio 2022 Community Edition which is free to install.

You need cmake installed.

This is a minimal example, not a product, meaning you need a CPU with intrinsics support for the features that are used.

```
1) mkdir build
2) cd build
3) cmake ..
4) open solution file, or just enter make
```

## Run
```
cd runtime
```

### Windows
```
.\Release\calc.exe
```
